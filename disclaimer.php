        <h5>Limitation of Liabilities</h5>
        <p>
          Under no circumstances, including negligence or fundamental breach,
          shall PrathTech hosting or any other party involved in providing the
          service be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or
          consequential damages or losses arising from the use of, or
          inability to use, the service, or resulting from errors, omissions,
          interruptions, delays in operation or transmission, or any failure
          of performance, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
          PrathTech hosting shall not be liable for any errors, omissions, or
          interruptions in service, whether within or outside its control. The
          service may be temporarily unavailable due to scheduled maintenance
          performed by PrathTech hosting or third-party providers, or due to
          other causes. Service interruptions may also occur at any time for
          customer or company protection. PrathTech hosting’s total liability
          and your exclusive remedy with respect to the services shall be
          limited to the total amount of service fees paid by you during the
          applicable prior period, if any. The provisions of this section
          shall survive any termination of these terms and conditions. In
          jurisdictions that restrict limitations of liability, PrathTech
          hosting’s liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted
          by law, regardless of the failure of the essential purpose of any
          limited remedy. You acknowledge that third-party product and service
          providers may advertise their products and services on the PrathTech
          hosting website. PrathTech hosting may form partnerships or
          alliances with certain vendors from time to time to facilitate the
          provision of such products and services. However, PrathTech hosting
          makes no representations or warranties regarding any third-party
          products or services and shall not be liable for any claims arising
          from or related to such products or services. You hereby disclaim
          and waive any rights or claims against PrathTech hosting related to
          third-party products and services, to the maximum extent permitted
          by law.
