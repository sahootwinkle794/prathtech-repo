        <h5>Your Privacy is Important to us</h5>
        <p>
          In the course of using this website or availing the products and
          services through online application forms and questionnaires, Prath
          Tech may become privy to the personal information of its clients,
          including information that is of a confidential nature.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prath Tech is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its
          clients and has taken all necessary and reasonable measures to
          protect the confidentiality of client information and its
          transmission through the web. While no data transmission over the
          Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will
          continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the
          protection of your confidential information.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a client, we would also urge you to cooperate with Prath Tech in
          order to ensure the security of your confidential information. It is
          recommended that each client carefully choose their passwords so
          that no unauthorized access is made by a third party. To make
          passwords complex and difficult for others to guess, customers
          should use a combination of alphabets, numbers, and special
          characters (like !, @, #, $ etc.). Each client should undertake not
          to disclose their password to anyone or keep any written or other
          record of the password in such a manner that a third party could
          access it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prath Tech undertakes not to disclose the information provided by
          the clients to any person, unless such action is necessary to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process.</li>
          <li>
            Protect and defend Prath Tech’s or its Affiliates’ rights,
            interests, or property.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enforce the terms and conditions of the products or services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Act to protect the interests of Prath Tech, its Affiliates, its
            members, constituents, or other persons.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Prath Tech will limit the collection and use of client information
          only on a need-to-know basis to deliver better service to the
          clients. Prath Tech may use and share the information provided by
          the clients with its Affiliates and third parties for providing
          services and any service-related activities, such as collecting
          subscription fees for such services and notifying or contacting the
          clients regarding any problems with, or the expiration of, such
          services. In this regard, it may be necessary to disclose client
          information to one or more agents and contractors of Prath Tech and
          their sub-contractors, but such agents, contractors, and
          sub-contractors will be required to agree to use the information
          obtained from Prath Tech only for these purposes.

          websites and organizations. We may also use third parties to display

          Often, these third-party advertising companies employ cookie and web
          bug technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be
          aware that different rules may apply to the collection, use, or
          disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with
          their advertisements, promotions, and other websites you encounter
          on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third parties
          is within their control and not ours, and even if we have a
          relationship with a third party, we do not control those sites or
          their policies and practices regarding your information. We
          encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in
          this regard.

          The client authorizes Prath Tech to exchange, share, or part with
          all information related to the details and transaction history of
          the clients with its Affiliates, banks, financial institutions,
          credit bureaus, agencies, or participation in any telecommunication
          or electronic clearing network, as may be required by law, customary
          practice, credit reporting, statistical analysis, credit scoring,
          verification, or risk management, and shall not hold Prath Tech
          liable for the use or disclosure of this information.

          Privacy Statement link on the front page of Prath Tech. If there are
          material changes to this Statement or in how Prath Tech will use
          your personal information, Prath Tech will prominently post such
          changes prior to implementing the change. Prath Tech encourages you
          to periodically review this Statement to be informed about how we
          are protecting your information.
